Browser Soundtrack is a Chrome extension that provides a soundtrack that fits your web browsing experience. It analyses the contents of the web page you are visiting and plays a relevant piece of music in the background. For example, when reading a blog post about Ruby, it will play Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs.
